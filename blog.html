  <img src="report.jpeg" alt="reporting">
  <p>This was my favorite part of the class when we reported about "roles and opportunities for information technology in meeting sustainability challenges," and the exciting part of this reporting was that we were like doing a capstone project and knowing what we will be as IT in the future.</p>

<div class="lisud">
  <p>I was challenged when Maam Jenny tasked us to make a report on "roles and opportunities for information technology in meeting sustainability challenges" because we didn't know where to begin. Me and my groupmates were brainstorming for hours. and I was also struggling because my groupmates assigned me to do the 3D model of our presentation.</p>
